Personal Utility Functions for R

Every now and then, while writing some basic functions, I find
myself thinking "Haven't I done this before?" 
So, I decided to create this package, in the hopes of increasing my
efficiency in writing R code. Of course, the time spent creating and
maintaining this package probably defeats the whole purpose, but we never
take into account the "fun" side of the equation when deciding whether to
automate or not...
